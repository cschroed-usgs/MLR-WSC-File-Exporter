# MLR-WSC-File-Exporter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-CIDA/MLR-WSC-File-Exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/USGS-CIDA/MLR-WSC-File-Exporter)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/USGS-CIDA/MLR-WSC-File-Exporter/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/USGS-CIDA/MLR-WSC-File-Exporter?branch=master)

Provides services which take an MLR Legacy location and write a MLR Legacy transaction file to a directory. The
directory can be specified with the environment variable, EXPORT_DIRECTORY, or by providing a alternative configuration file
in .env. If neither are provided, the file will be written to the project's home directory.

This project has been built and tested with python 3.6.x. To build the project locally you will need
python 3 and virtualenv installed.
```bash
% virtualenv --python=python3 env
% env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the tests:
```bash
env/bin/python -m unittest
```
The test output (for success) looks like:
```

To run the application locally execute the following:
```bash
% env/bin/python app.py
```

The swagger documentation can then be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api

The 
Default configuration variables can be overridden be creating a .env file. For instance, to turn debug on you will want 
to create an .env with the following:
```python
DEBUG = True
```

For local development, you will need to provide a JWT token to the service. This can be done through the Swagger 
documents by clicking the Authorize button and entering 'Bearer your.jwt.token'.

You can use a valid JWT token generated by another service. You will need to set it's JWT_PUBLIC_KEY to the public key 
used to generate the token, as well as the JWT_DECODE_AUDIENCE (if any) and the JWT_ALGORITHM (if different than RS256). 
If you don't want to verify the cert on this service, set AUTH_CERT_PATH to False.

Alternatively, you can generate your own token by using the python package jwt. In the python interpreter, do the following
```python
import jwt
jwt.encode({'authorities': ['one_role', 'two_role']}, 'secret', algorithm='HS256')
```
The output of this command will be the token that you can use. You will need to set JWT_SECRET_KEY to 'secret' in your local .env file. 
See http://flask-jwt-simple.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options.html for the other options that you can use.

Since this service requires authentication, you will also need to set AUTHORIZED_ROLES in your .env file to whatever you use to
generate the token.
